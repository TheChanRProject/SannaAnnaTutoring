\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  \item Find the total perimeter of the grazing area.
  \item If the cost of the fence is \$ 7.95 per linear foot, how much will it cost to place a fence around the entire grazing area?
  \item Suppose the grazing area is 1/60 of an industrial grazing area for a major industry farm. What is the total cost to build a fence around the entire land of a large scaled farm?
\end{enumerate}
Part I Solution:
\begin{align}
  A = \frac{1}{2}aP \\
  a = 10 \\
  A = 500 \\
  500 = \frac{1}{2}10P \\
  P = \frac{500}{5} \\
  P = 100
\end{align}
Part II Solution:
\begin{align}
  Cost = \$7.95 * 100 = \$795
\end{align}
Part III Solution:
\begin{align}
  Total Cost = 60 * Cost = 60 * 795 = \$ 47,700 
\end{align}
