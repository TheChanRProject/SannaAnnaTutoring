Archimedes said that the object placed in water displaces the same volume of water as the object's volume. In order to solve his problem regarding the fake gold objects, he would first have to find the volume of the gold object and then put it in water. If the object within the water changing the volume of the water displaced turns out to be the same volume as the object, then the object is made out of real gold. If the volumes are not the same, then the object is fake gold.
