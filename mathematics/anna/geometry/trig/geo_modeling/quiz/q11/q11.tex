We first need to find the volume of the box being shipped. Then we need to find the volume of each cookie box. Once we know the two volumes, we divide the shipping box volume by the cookie box volume.
\begin{align}
  V_{\text{shipping box}} = 12 * 10 * 12 in^3 \\
  V{\text{cookie box}} = 4 * 5 * 3 in^3 \\
  n_{\text{cookie boxes}} = \frac{1440}{60} = 24
\end{align}
24 cookie boxes will fit into the box being shipped.
