  In order to find out which race B is more likely to lose, we need to compare the probabilites of the two races given that B has won.
  \begin{align}
    P(D | B) = \frac{60}{100} \\
    P(E | B) = \frac{25}{100} \\
    P(D | B) > P(E | B)
  \end{align}
  Since Event D or the 100 meter event has better odds for B to win, B most likely lost Event E, the 800 meter event.
