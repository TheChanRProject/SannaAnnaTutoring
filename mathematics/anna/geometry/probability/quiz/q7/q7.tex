  The percentage of all races being ties is:
  \begin{align}
    P(T) = \frac{35}{200} = 17.50\%
  \end{align}
To find out if A or B are more likely to win, we need to tally up how many races A won and how many B won and compare their percentages against the total number of races.
\begin{align}
  P(A) = \frac{80}{200} \rightarrow 40\% \\
  P(B) = \frac{75}{200} \rightarrow 37.50\% \\
\end{align}
A has a greater chance of winning the race today since it has 2.50\% higher probability than B.
