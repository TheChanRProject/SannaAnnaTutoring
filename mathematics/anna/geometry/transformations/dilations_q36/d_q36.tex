The first step is to get the scale factor. To do this, we will look at RS and R'S' .
\begin{align}
R (1, 2), S (1,1), R' (3, 6), S' (3,3) \\
RS = 1 \\
R'S' = 3 \\
K = \frac{3}{1} = 3
\end{align}
To test whether or not the dilation is centered at the origin, we can simply take one point from the pre image such as R and multiply the x and y values by the scale factor.
\begin{align}
  D_{O, 3} \rightarrow R (1, 2) = (3, 6) \\
  D_{0, 3} = R'
\end{align}
The dilation that can be mapped from RST to R'S'T' is $D_{O, 3}$ .
