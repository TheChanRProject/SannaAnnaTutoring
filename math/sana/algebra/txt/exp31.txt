 The equation to model this situation can be:

 y = 2^(x/4) + 3 since the wage increases by 2 every 4 years and the starting wage is $3.

In order to make up for year 0, we can set it up as a piecewise function.

{
y = 3 when x = 0
y = 2^(x/4) + 3 when x > 0
}

At year 0, y = 3

(0, 3)

At year 4, y = 5
y = 2^1 + 3
(4, 5)

At year 8, y = 7
y = 2^2 + 3
(8, 7)

At year 12, y = 11
y = 2^3 + 3
(12, 11)

At year 16, y = 19
y = 2^4 + 3
(16, 19)
