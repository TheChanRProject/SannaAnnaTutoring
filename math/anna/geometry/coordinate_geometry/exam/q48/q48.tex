To use the slopes of the sides of the figure below, we must do the following to prove it is a right triangle:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute both slopes
  \item Ensure their product is equivalent to -1
\end{itemize}
By seeing their product is negative 1, we can prove the two slopes are perpendicular hence creating a 90$^\circ$ angle.

The slope of the vertical leg is :
\begin{align}
  \frac{6 - 1}{1 - 1} \rightarrow \text{undefined}
\end{align}
The slope of the horizontal leg is :
\begin{align}
  \frac{1 - 1}{4 - 1} = 0
\end{align}
An undefined slope and a slope equal to 0 are perpendicular just as an x axis and a y axis are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, the triangle is a right triangle.
